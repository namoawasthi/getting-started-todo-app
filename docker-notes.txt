What is an image/Dockerfile?

Without going too deep yet, think of a container image as a single package that contains everything needed to run a process. In this case, it will contain a Node environment, the backend code, and the compiled React code.

Any machine that runs a container using the image, will then be able to run the application as it was built without needing anything else pre-installed on the machine.

A Dockerfile is a text-based script that provides the instruction set on how to build the image. For this quick start, the repository already contains the Dockerfile.

Pushing images
You can push a new image to this repository using the CLI:

docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
docker push new-repo:tagname
Make sure to replace tagname with your desired image repository tag.

To push a new tag to this repository:

docker push namoawasthi/getting-started-todo-app:tagname

Command Pallete
Docker: Prune System command will remove stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks and volumes.

docker build -t namoawasthi/getting-started-todo-app .
docker image ls

docker push namoawasthi/getting-started-todo-app: first_image_push
